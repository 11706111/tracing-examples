# SignalFx Distributed Tracing Examples

This repository contains a set of simple example applications that demonstrate
using SignalFx with various open source tracers.  We do not yet have our own
tracer, so you must use a third-party tracer configured to send to the SignalFx
ingest server using the Zipkin v2 JSON format.
