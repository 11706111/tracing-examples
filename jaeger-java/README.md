# Jaeger Java Example

This is a very simple Java class that shows the use of the Jaeger Java tracer client with SignalFx.
See [./src/main/java/com/signalfx/tracing/examples/App.java](./src/main/java/com/signalfx/tracing/examples/App.java)
for the code and more information.

## Other Resources

Here is a good tutorial on general use (not SignalFx-specific) of the Jaeger Java implementation:
