# Zipkin Javascript

OpenTracing currently only has [two Javascript libraries
instrumented](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=javascript&type=&language=),
but Zipkin currently supports [a much larger
set](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-js#instrumentations) so we recommend
using [Zipkin's JS tracer](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-js).  It works
in both Node and the browser.
